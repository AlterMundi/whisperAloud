# WHISP-4: Prepare the first real act of work

## Summary

Somewhere in the backlog, the first true task waits — not this one (this one is merely a demonstration of potential). When it arrives, greet it with the discipline it deserves: status before action, attribution before execution, breadcrumbs before moving on.

## Technical Plan

<!-- Implementation approach, design decisions, open questions. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- What must be true for this task to be done? -->
